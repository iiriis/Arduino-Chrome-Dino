# Arduino-Chrome-Dino
Chrome's Dino Game in Arduino

## What it does
It is a simple yet fun Chrome Dino Arduino pushbutton LCD game that you can play at home.

## How we built it
We built it on Tinkercad using components like Arduino, LCD, pushbuttons, potentiometer, and breadboard. 

## Challenges we ran into
Doing it in a very short time was a massive challenge.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
Completing the project and then being able to play it was the greatest achievement of them all.
 
## What we learned
We learned about how to create bitmap characters. 

## What's next for Arduino Chrome Dino 
Building a real-time hardware version of it and incorporating some arcade-like sounds to it as well.
